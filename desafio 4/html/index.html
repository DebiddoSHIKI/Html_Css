            I'm getting tired <br>
            Of this technology <br>
            We only talk by email <br>
            Short and cold messages <br>
            Twitter and Facebook <br>
            Before I get old <br>
            I'm going to say everything in poetry. <br>

            It's not like it used to be <br>
            Everything is abbreviated <br>
            "VocÃª" only has two letters <br>
            The "O" and the "E" were crossed out<br>
            To declare love <br>
            Just put a flower <br>
            And a heart drawn. <br>

            The at sign is now worthless <br>
            It's part of an address <br>
            No full stop is even used <br>
            Or it even goes at the beginning <br>
            Now it's .com
            If the site is really good <br>
            It's worth a high price. <br>
    
            To make matters worse, the language <br>
            The emoticon is a risk <br>
            There is a symbol for everything <br>
            A semicolon and an asterisk <br>
            A kiss means <br>
            To understand how it looks <br>
            Decipher this scribble. <br>

            I miss the letters <br>
            Written with your own hand <br>
            I sent them in June <br>
            They only arrived in the summer <br>
            But they quenched my longing
            They were real text <br>
            In the lines of the heart. <br>
        </p>

            Now, I write and send <br>
            Arriving at the same time <br>
            But when I go to chat <br>
            The person left <br>
            Opened another app <br>
            The world was captive <br>
            Of the technology of now. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, to pray <br>
            You don't need the internet <br>
            God listens to everyone <br>
            If you want, take this test <br>
            Two dots are two knees <br>
            Your lips are devices <br>
            Let God interpret. <br>
